// For multi dimensional array 
// formula to get the index of the element in the memory => c*i+j

// c is no of column 
// i is the row index 
// j is the column index 

//    [[1,2,3],
//     [4,5,6],
//     [7,8,9]]  
// 
//   but the array in memory is like => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// 
//   therefor the index of the elements in memory is not same as we do like in matrix format
